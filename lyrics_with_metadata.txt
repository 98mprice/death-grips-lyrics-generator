He come to me with money in his hand
He offered me, I didn't ask him
I wasn't knocking someone's door down, I was running from that
When I got out, I was in that
I was already through that, I had that
I had the studio, I went to the studio
I went to Vox Studios. I had it all, and I looked at it and said, 'This is a bigger jail than I just got out of.'
I don't want to take my time going to work
I got a motorcycle and a sleeping bag
And ten or fifteen girls
What the hell I wanna go off into -- and go to work for?
Work for what, money? I got all the money in the world
I'm the king, man
I run the underworld, guy
I decide whos does what and where they do it at
What am I, gonna run around and act like I'm some teenybopper somewhere, for somebody else's money?
I make the money, man, I roll the nickels
The game is mine
I deal the cards
(Beware)

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow
'Cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

Trips to where few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow
Of the ebb and flow, where the roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below the bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order, elitist horde of creeping fire, seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm, time is gone
Moonlight drawn, fly till dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm of the coming storm
In blood sworn to glorify and for life adorn
With all that dies to become unborn

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship

In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns
Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse
The spiral storm of flames inside
The torch I raise, the force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches' blood
Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitch's leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise into apocalyptic skies
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with naught to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns within my gut
As my bones turn into dust

[Refrain]
And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow
'Cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship

[Outro]
What up, ____?
Man, uh, seein' what's goin' on with it
In case you guys got to see, uh-
Thinkin' about headin' out, here
____'s gonna come through and smoke some
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes yah!

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 1]
Sit in the dark and ponder how
I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor
And they all fall down - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes - yuh!)
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke
Stomp music seriously - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes)
Can't stop the groove licks jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected
To everything you want, ever did want, we got it why not come get it
Stick your head in that hole and watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yuh! yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 2]
Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat
Causes my jaws to call out, out, out, out - yuh!
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that’s ever been said - yuh!
Tie the chord, kick the chair and you're dead - yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 3]
Head of a trick in a bucket, body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it, gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted by the stench of rot is such a drag - yuh!
Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yuh!
Choke on these nuts till the very last - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes)
Serial number, killing machine, the illest of means
To an end built on the filthy sound you're experiencing - yuh! yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 4]
Tinted windows, bulletproof
The slip knot fixing rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel
The passion that blinds me so I feel - yuh!
Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down - yuh!

Spread eagle 'cross the block
Spread eagle 'cross the block
Spread eagle 'cross the block

[Hook 1]
I fuck the music, I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Hit hit hit!

[Verse 1]
Want a beer? Have no fear, comes and goes, man it's here
No one knows, feels so weird when it blows through my bones
I got a jones for it, I wanna know more
Cause it's 'bout what I got to show for it
I want some more of it, I want too much
I got so bored with it, I shot it up
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up
(Yeah!)
What is it? Where is it? How will it affect me?
Fuck that shit, I need that shit's bound to be the death of me
Fuck buying it I'm taking it and sharing it with nobody

[Refrain]
Cause all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job

[Verse 2]
I own that shit, on some throw back shit, you already know that shit
You even know 'bout how I know the man who grows that, biatch!
You can't buy it with your money, you can't find it overseas
It's one of those things that seems outlandish 'til you have it's not a dream
As for me, I'm cool with it and that's alright cause it's my thing

[Bridge 1]
What is it? Where is it? How will it affect me?

[Verse 3]
Work that angle 'til it's beveled, curve of the blade doubled
Edge made to bleed the struggle, best believe the game's a hustle
Observer of the strange occurrences, conjurer of the subtle
Unseen but felt disturbances that burst a bitch's bubble
That’s right it’s all mine, never was yours
Like how you wait in line while I walk straight through the door, straight through the-
Hear you say something but ain't nothing, spectators ignored
Pay no mind to that chump's just a player-hatin' whore

[Hook 2]
I fuck the music, I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Ain’t no fun if the aliens can't have none

[Verse 4]
How I fuck it dirty, how I make it twitch and scream
How it screams, "Oh, baby, hurt me. Work me to the bone. Oh, please"
How I bend the rhythm over and hit, hit, hit it on my knees
Give, give, give it up, I need it all the time
Bleed it on the drop of a dime, down to pound it 'til it shines
Moonlit lake of blood red wine, make no mistake, I makes it mine
Break shit down and make it grind to the groove used to align
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds
Through secrets behind and between every time I scream:
"Shit is mine! It's all mine!
All the time! Shit is mine!"

[Bridge 2]
What is it? Where is it? How will it affect me?
Fuck that shit, I need that shit
(Yeah)

[Verse 5]
Thought you knew, thought you thought, thought you did but did not
Come on through; What you got? Is it cool? Is it hot?
Check one two, man don't stop, I'm not through black blood clot
In my view like that twat spread eagle 'cross the block
(Spread eagle 'cross the block)
(Spread eagle 'cross the block)
(Spread eagle 'cross the block)
Need no ego to rock
What we know just gets dropped, how we keep shit on lock

[Refrain]
Cause all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job

[Outro]
Shit is mine, it's all mine
All the time, shit is mine

Into the flame, into the fire
With no regard for a thing, fuck that I'm the lord of the game
I rule this empire (I am the God of Hell Fire!)
Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cause no one has came even close to the train
Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver
Whippin' the wheel
Flippin' donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base; where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel
It so much my gut burns like the tires
Movin' this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done
For the real ones packin' real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come
(Fuckin' cowards)

[Hook: MC Ride & Mexican Girl]
When they tell you you must take it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you you must take it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you you must take it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you you must take it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low

[Verse 2: MC Ride]
Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cause no one has came even close to the train of thought
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Which we maintain
Like soldiers of fame
And fortune denied as to to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
War is never done, think it is you die
Where was I now?
Like I said before
Hear someone knockin'
At my front door
Who could it be? Should I ignore
The knockin' or see what could be in store
For me if I leave the safety of the shore?
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia? (Is it real?)
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel?
When they ask if you can make it
And you don't wanna go

[Hook: MC Ride & Mexican Girl] x4
When they tell you you must take it
And you think hell no

When they tell you you must take it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you you must take it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low

[Verse 3: MC Ride]
Rather be stuck naked
(Hits so low)
Than waste my time like the last time
And every time before that
Don't waste my time even one more time
When you know that shit is whack
Don't make me remind of you of the last time you
Said you'd never go back

[Outro: MC Ride & Mexican Girl]
Fuck where you're from
Fuck where you're goin'
It's all about where you're at

[Verse 1]
Tak-kyon, Tak-kyon
Tak-kyon, Tak-
Triple six, five, forked tongue
Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones

[Hook]
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

[Verse 2]
Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like "Fuck, what was that?"
Man I don’t know, but it made me feel so heated
How we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know
Cause even if you did, you’d keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat
We make beats catch
Beat it 'til it bleeds to death, each track
Epileptic seize every head we crack
Like EPMD snapping necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map

[Hook]
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

[Verse 3]
Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale 'til the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird
Try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't cause its way too sheer
How to make a hater disappear
Take shit where it ain’t never been
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with it
10, 9, 8, 7, triple six, five, forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm
Get out the way or get up torn
Ain’t a picture big enough to fit
What we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was
Militant march of this war

[Bridge]
Takyon - taking them down
All we see is blood
Takyon - turning them out
How to trick out and freak that buzz

[Hook]
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

[Verse 4]
Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip
Off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here’s the deal, if you don’t feel ill
Don’t want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get
With that shit gets dial toned
Takyon - bitch slapping pussy clots and clones
Takyon - setting off Unabombs inside your dome
Give it up, bitch, you know this is it
Get with this or get left cause it's on!
Takyon

What ya gonna do when they come for you?

Ain’t never done shit
Stash what you got cause they're comin' through
Best get rid of that quick
Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip

[Bridge]
Minding my own business
Minding my own business
Minding my own business
Minding my own business

[Verse 1]
Try to hem me up like for life
Stuck in the klink, haters in blue
How they set me up? Should I test my luck?
Here they come, they're in pursuit
What did I do? What haven't I done?
You want to see my I.D.? Umm...
Well, ok, where I'm coming from? Just on my way, not on the run
What you want me to say? Are you just 'bout done?
Power trippin', asshole lickin' haters
Notice how they strut through the spot
Like anybody wants to see a cop
Man, everybody knows they suck
I got to be somewhere, man, fuck
Why the hell you always stoppin' me
Round the clockin' me, like what?

[Hook]
What ya gonna do when they come for you?

[Verse 2]
Six feet deep below the street
So they can't never say shit again
Fuck the man with a thick broomstick
And put a black flag on the end
Got to watch my back or just like that
I’m bound to get locked up
The law's watching me constantly
Too close and way too much
Looking over my shoulder
And checking in the rear view mirror
Cause I'm never not but a moment
From getting taken to jail
They're knocking at my door, down my door
They're shining lights in my eyes
Exactly what do they stand for?
Ever asking more of I, man, why?
Like it matters why I chose to ignore
All the laws I've been told to abide
Think I’m on parole, thinking I just stole
Some shit, you got an A.P.B out on-
But no, you're wrong as usual
Hell no, it wasn't me
Have the nerve to ask me if I'm drunk
When I’m pissing in the middle of the street
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my-

[Verse 3]
By the way why they always acting
Like they know how to size me up?
Ignorant bastards coming after me
All the time on mine, had enough
Why they always wanna hassle me?
Pigs all up on my nuts
Like they have to be, like I can't see 'em
Tryin' to play shade tree in the cuts
By robbing me of my dignity
So in the end, I never say much
But ain’t a time pass I don’t wish I could flash
On Penelope like fuck

[Outro]
Shot this for everyone who's been there
For my real ones who understand
What it feels like to have your rights read to you
By the-

So softly a supergod dies

[Verse 1]
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Useless information occupies every open space inside your skull
You know what's going on every day, every night
Everywhere, swear you're so international
Upside down cross on the Jumbotron
Wait up, hold on
Blowing anthrax off my palms
Say what, you're wrong
Switch stance, face plant
Napalm fire starters
Flatlander, plug puller
Nose dive turbulence chartered
You speak in abbreviations because real life conversation moves too slow
You're the media's creation, yeah, your free will has been taken and you don't know

Never seen without one hundred
She's a satanic priestess
Anarchy on ice freak flag flying faceless elitist
Crow on the down low end
Reppin' Orion's belt
Atlantis ancient vagina
Getting dusty on the shelf
Enter the pigs don't get it
No hands I'm shattering jaws
Double nickles on the dime
Fuck glam can lick my balls

[Refrain]
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

[Verse 3]
Whatchya gonna be when you're grown, young blood?
Gonna be a helpless drone
Won't ever have to think
No, your head'll be linked directly to your cell phone
The virus is alive, I can see it in your eyes
The infection is full blown
Qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu
Career killer, double decker packed with suicidal brides
Four-armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches' thighs
Enters through unknowing eyes
Touch the keys; it's in your mind
Can't delete it and soon you'll find
How bad you need it all the time

Shiva slashin' through your flat screen
Is nowhere for you to hide
Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide
My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons
Vampire on the rise
Punk a chump with a cunt for brains platoon
In the zone and on the grind
Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks

Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
(If you're delusional, your call will be transferred to the mother ship)
Ugh! Yes, I like the drugs

[Verse 1]
I'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you
Plutonium lore, what this is, what this for
Feel my fists push black holes through your bitch ass decor
Spit it back like a whore and make you shit your fucking drawers
Scared to ride, cowards fall before my eyes, sound of my balls
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons, drug by demons down your halls
Can't imagine what's fit to happen when I get to flashing, see the small
Shrink to a fraction of what they're lacking and less than that in no time at all
Can't believe they have the gaul to try and act
Like they’re not trapped between these walls
Bring it (Bring it)
Kill it

[Hook]
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there, never get there
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here? Wanna leave here
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
And if I can, were they even ever there at all? Not at all
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just don’t give a damn, twist a gram
And keep on sticking with the original plan, fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged, even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of, don’t know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much, there you go
How it is now's how it always was, that’s on my blood
How it is now's how it always was, that’s on my blood

[Hook]
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it

[Verse 3]
See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, cause I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that
We paint our insides black as the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack, the part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it
Check it, bring it, kill it
On everything I own, swear would rather slit my throat
And die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before
I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane
Staring at the ceiling, in the dark
Trying not to let the feeling, tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing, and it won't stop
Tell yourself it's almost over, but it's not

[Intro]
Get it
Get it
Get it
Known for it
Get it
Get it
Known for it

[Verse 1]
Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, till I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was 'bout to crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had to do it
Hacked into it

[Hook 1]
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it

[Hook 2]
Let them eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits with a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon to freak this

[Verse 2]
You can tell me what you said - go ahead
But no sooner than you said it
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds
Keep 'em guessin' endlessly
Never let 'em know where you're headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How to show 'em they don’t mean shit to me
Put 'em in their place, cause they ought to be
Kept in the dark, not 'posed to see never, but only so much of me
Double O.G. with a skeleton key
Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory
Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or it’ll take everything you own, floor it
(Get it, get it)

[Hook 1]
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it

[Verse 3]
Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How to ride it inside out of the clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don’t doubt it
You might just need it
Already did that
Can't never go back
Yeah fuck that
Gets the bozack
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out, abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don’t trip
If you have one let a man know so I could flip a bitch and kill it
(Get it)
Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it to wind, 'round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed cause I will be damned if mine ever decays
Forever on attack gut check the blind
Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life
Cause I am known for it

[Hook 1]
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?

[Hook 2]
Let them eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits with a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon to freak this

Known for it

[Hook 1]
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?

Known for it

Been workin' way too much need to get out and get fucked up
What's going on? Where's it at?
Make some calls to make it crack, let's see
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside
The mission:

[Verse 1]
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way
Be it acid on the tongue
Cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs
Like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more
So till dawn we're okay, but anyway

[Verse 2]
Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink, and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a good buzz going
Cause everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And she's looking so you’re knowing
You could get it tonight
But there’s so much around
Best take your time, do it right

[Verse 3]
As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that’s left of you
Is your most primal desires
Ass clappin', dick suckin', lock the door to the bathroom – quick fuckin'
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin', cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out
Before you even get a chance to think 'bout what you're doing

[Hook 1]
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

[Verse 4]
Getting looser and looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin'
You're cruisin', you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a-
Cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding cause your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me, I'm all about the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song?
You know, the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Till they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way, I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as it's done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy’s hella horny
And their pussies don't smell

[Bridge 1]
Argh...
Where's it at?

[Hook 2]
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
(Bitch) Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

[Verse 5]
Responsibility's cool, but there’s more things in life
Like getting your dick rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more cause you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright
It's time to find one and take one
Right now
It's time to find one and make one say
"I'm down"
Think I just found one, 'bout to break one off
Meanwhile

[Bridge 2]
Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles
May have gotten too fucked up cause I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try

[Verse 6]
First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do, let's hope my story isn’t all about haters
Where's it at? Cause I want it like, man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me cause I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Where's it at?

[Hook 3]
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch

[Outro]
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

Pass that shit

[Verse 1]
Hold on man
Park the car
I have no idea where we are
Think we may have drove too far
Yeah I can see they're right behind us
But there's nothing we can do
We can't get caught slipping, get off that shit and just be cool
They're on to us
But don't look now
They think they're 'bout to take us down
Fuck that, I'm not going out

[Bridge 1]
Pass that shit

[Verse 2]
At the next corner, turn left
It's time to handle this
Nowhere to go don't trip
Have no time for that pussy sh-- AGH
In a minute it'll all be finished
What you don't think I speak the truth
You think I could just be sittin' here
Listenin' to Sonic Youth
Anywhere when they try to ride
On you thinking I'm gone
I'll creep up on 'em from behind
And break 'em off one by one
In the time it takes you to blink your eyes
Shit'll already be done
But just in case anything goes wrong
Keep your right hand on your-

[Hook]
So when they step up out the car
Yeah, I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'
Blood creepin'

[Verse 3]
Shake the bottle what's it hold
How many have I already sold
Hope not too much cause I feel insane
Need more than one to numb the pain
Slithering through my brain
Thoughts stuck on that train
Off the track and up in flames
Fuck it, I'll swallow these blue ones
Yeah, and maybe this big one
And I might as well take a few more with me just in case I get some
I know you want 'em, yeah, no problem
Got that covered, tramp, I brought 'em
How it creeps up on me so slowly
I don't notice my eyes rolling
To the back of my head and falling
Shit, somebody's calling
Can't answer the phone
Call 'em back when I'm 'bout to leave
Can't think straight, man, I'm so fucking blown

[Hook]
So when they step up out the car
Yeah, I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'
Blood creepin'

[Bridge 2]
Down the alleys in the middle of the night
I'm trashed, so high it's hard to ride my bike
Might crash whenever I'm this fucked up
Drunken monkey through the cuts
Who gives a fuck?

[Outro]
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'
Blood creepin
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'
Blood creepin'

Get get get get got got got got
Blood rush to my head bit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot

[Verse 1]
Tailpipe draggin’, volume blastin’, bailin’ out my brain
Red light flash, dem stop I smash
Abraxas, hydroplane, massive
Catch this flight flow rainin’ madness
Mastered mine and laced
The ave with black cat fish tailin’ waves of stratus
Curb right to far left lane
Don’t wait for me, if I care
'Bout anything, anywhere
Losin’ myself, I get the stares
What I’m lookin’ at, wasn’t there
Wasn’t there, wasn’t there
Wasn’t there, wasn’t there
Nothin’ out there, can’t stay inside
Hit the bar, sleep deprived
Who drove the car? I’m still alive
Up in smoke, moon was low
How’d you know, didn’t say I did
Whose is this? You know what this is
But do you know?

[Chorus]
Get get get get got got got got
Blood rush to my head bit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot
Fly inside out
Rot dem big shot simp slot shit but a one hit quick stop

[Verse 2]
So many ways to skin the frame
Remember when first got strange
Now I just think it life obey
So what comes next right away
Right away, right away
Right away, right away
Raise the cup, tilt it dry
Come black cloud, cover the sky
Tongue through pupil of your eye
Sickness moves you can’t deny
Lickin' through you, mastermind
For mercy man cry
Yeah, I’m knowin' and you know why
Nail through mental ever dem try
Pigeon hole me get crucified
Can’t clone this edge
What’s it cost to lose your head
Wit out end up lost
Should be askin' where’s the safe
Born with a ski mask on my face

[Chorus]
Get get get get got got got got
Blood rush to my head bit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot

[Verse 3]
Lycanthropic manic cycles
Fire water, burnin' bibles
Wake up ragin', call a taxi
Take me to the nearest city
Cell light up, yeah get at me
Make it quick though, blood, I'm busy
Get busy, get busy, get busy, get busy
Drilled a hole into my head
Pierced the bone and felt the breeze
Lift my thoughts out dem sick bed
Wit a pair of crow skeleton wings
Know nothin’ since then it seems
Been floatin’ through the nexus threadin’ dreams
But did you know?
Yo

[Chorus]
Get get get get got got got got
Blood rush to my head bit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot
Get get get get got got got got
Blood rush to my head bit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot

How'd you know? 'Cause I was there
Yeah, that shit go, came prepared
Set it slow rolled, anticipation grow slow
Deviated septum, blow hole, sugar cane ko ko
Ayy, ayy, pass the dro my way or no way twenty fo'
No 25-8, thought you knew, suicide lane, fuck you
Grab my crotch, what's my name? Been 'round the block
Hangin' scumbag slangin', pay dirt cave in, takin' no prisoners
No escaping wash brain hook, nothin' I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy, know what I'm sayin?

[Chorus]
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the fever, I got the fever
I got the fever, I got the fever

[Verse 2]
Sprayin' execution, witch fingernails clawin' through them
Crawlin' through them tunnels, losing touch with everything I'm doin'
Argh, mass confusion, can't make more electrocution
Half cocked, full tilt, rabid dog, filth, argh, know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck it, upside down in a soft top bucket, screamin', shred it

[Chorus]
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the fever, I got the fever

[Verse 3]
Let me off, screeching halt, concussion blinding, not my fault
Ankles tied to cinder blocks, ayy, ayy
By any means necesserated, blade cut me, sewer drain grated
Bubonic plague spreaded faceless, lurking in the deadest spaces
On your knees, black goat anus, christo anti-clan of shameless
Came to whip those into shapeless, here we go, devastated
(Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go)
(Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go)
Diamonds scrapin' the marrow, out my core
Who's in the mirror? Who's at the door?
Someone's there, wasn't there before
Ceiling connected to the chord, pull it, pull that shit, pull that shit

[Chorus]
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the fever, I got the fever
I got the fever, I got the fever

Other side of the tracks
Scuzz outsiders
Nothin' to loose
Strike of midnighters
(Lost boys)
True black and blues
No shoes, flat tires
Broke out the pen
Blood on barbed wire
Safe in your home
Gated zone terrorizers
Nowhere to go
Far as I can get hitchhikers

[Verse 2]
Fuck a job, might have to rob
And don't know just to get by, word
On the road for lifers
Bullets in the fire
Check the chain link
Swayze, I'm slummin'
Let 'em know who the fuck we are
Low and dirty lost boys
Comin' out the cuts
Like your favorite scar
Crawlin 'on tile, can't stand up
Been a while, kommodo gut
How to take it
How to give a fuck
How to live with pain
How to get your cut
How long's this been goin' on?
Man shit no way to tell too far gone, go get those flames from hell bring em here
Don't trip, no
I'll handle this
On some scandalous
Inland empire, Los Angeles
Anti-ego propaganda shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who's comin' up? Who's losin' ground?
2012, I'm shady now, running game on every thing in town

[Chorus]
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys

[Bridge]
It's such a long way down

[Verse 3]
Brown paper baggin', asphalt scrapin', all talk no action, what I'm waitin'
Weak tongue waggin'
Stray dog beggin'
Like don't hurt me
Yeah right, I'm sayin'
Beware you have been warned, the barrels still warm, ease up off that lip or step
How quick a bitch fit to get checked, mate
One false move'll get ya
Set straight
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Chorus]
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys

Bow down or die everytime

Flat black chains rattlin'
Shawshank the box
Can't be contained
Man came to pick the lock
Empty the vault
And leave no trace
Sleep don't wake
Hit 'em low and keep rollin' to the beat no breaks
Slow it down then accelerate
To hell it's cake
Like sellin' weight
No middle man
Made bitch mistakes

High king, ace, to knees the place put down by G's raisin' the stakes

With a Glock tongue cocked
Run it back

Flat line of chalk drawn 'round the clock too many marks dropped to count the stiffs
Stuck on the fence
How does it feel?
It don't make sense

And only never know me never will, no son

That can't wait to blast
Blood-stained knuckle brass gives a fuck sick with it flav on
That ex-con
Hard to the bone
Darkness from the zone
Mastered and pushed far beyond
Eons beyond the line never crossed
By them punks livin' soft while I ride that bomb
Dr. Strangelove
Into the sun
Look no hands megatons
Rode like man we can't lose
No shit, no shit
That hit it till it drip with
The blood of the raw way
It was 'fore them forgot
Why doin' dirt, make slang sound tough gong original
Fuck the wrong way
Only one real way to work

Beat street spit
Über freaked heat lit
Hell flame to your brain
Blood thirst

Run it back, run it

Get up
Beats ‘bout waist deep
Swallowed by beats
I stay niche
I stay—
Get up
Beats ‘bout waist deep
Swallowed by beats
I stay niche
I've seen footage

[Verse 1]
What's that?
Can't tell
Handheld dream
Shot in hell
Deep space ghetto streets
Show me somethin'
I ain't seen before
Mystery 'hind that death door
Juke step electrocute the floor
What's the science of
Flyin' that high?
Got a no-no goin'
One time
Creeps up behind me
Over my shoulder
Turn around, try to see, but it's
Nowhere
Noided, noided
Static on my blindside

[Hook]
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-

[Verse 2]
Everybody's knowin'
Where ya think you're goin' ain't goin' nowhere
Satellite, handle that
With a lead pipe
Who captures life
Who takes what's left, who stay
On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you
Don't touch me
What's up with it
(I stay noided) Stimulation overload account for it
Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit
I've seen it, I've been it
Can't delete it, feels like jail
Full moon in the klink
Shining, don't sleep
Surveillance post my bail

[Hook]
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-

Armored cop open fire Glock
On some kid who stepped so
Fast was hard to grasp what even happened 'til you seen that head blow
Off his shoulders in slow-mo
Rewind that, it's so cold
Rewind that, it's so cold
I've seen footage, I stay noided
Juke step with so much boy-rude looseness seem like
No bones in him skin
My jaw hit the floor, like "This real footage, gotta see that one mo' 'gain"
Ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in Brazil
Little tiger, boy soldier
Twist cap back and kill

[Bridge 2]
Seen crazy shit, man, crazy shit
Seen crazy shit, man, crazy shit

Bitch, you don't know me
Run it, blood, ride reel to reel low key
How's it feel, feel, feel, easy
Make it bloody, make it bloody
Ain't really nothin' else
I see any more
Gone in the cause
I'm bleeding for

[Hook 2]
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know I freak it
Double, double helix

[Verse 2]
Live in a trance, can't see you
Don't want to anyway, anywhere
What'd you say? Forgot you were even there
Head float astray
Clear the air
Be back when you think I'm gone
Blue jay way, don't belong
Double helix phoenix
From beyond
(Double, so you really wanna know how I freak it)
Rorschach ink blot
In the street
Skid row mark
Show me the beast
I'm the lust, you can't hide
That balled up, fist gut inside
Strapped to, suicide
Missions set off
With so much pride
You can see it
In a dead man's eyes
(So you really wanna know)
No maps with directions
No answers, just questions
Second guessing everything you swore was so, can't
Tell you what to do
But I'll tell you why I threw
All the rules out the window
And took an oath to be true
With the one and only view
A man can ever truly know, know, know, know

[Hook 2]
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna how
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know I freak it
Double, double helix

[Bridge]
Been there and back
'Nough tracks I am
The rail to the road
We run like scam

[Verse 3]
Drop it on the one
And it's on like damn
Well I never thought
Uh huh, oh yeah
Like I didn't know
Wake up, young blood
Ain't nobody sleepin'
And they never was
Off the cliff in a blur of black blood and hoodoo hexin' guts I thought you heard them ghetto birds hollering every time I bust
Swallow it down and lap it up, can't do that, I'm-a have to cut

[Outro]
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know I freak it
Double
So you really wanna know how I freak it

You know what I'm sayin'?
Kill it or die
Braggin' about how you
Had it all dialed
Well, what's up now
When your shit is-

[Verse 1]
How I'm comin', why I'm slingin'
Where I'm from and what I'm bringin'
Tell your cousins, best stop sleepin' cause I'm bustin' for no reason at random murder
Killing season
But no one heard me
Cold blood creepin'
Full tilt swervin'
Through your bleedin'
System burnin' to its knees and
Beggin' for mercy while I'm leanin'
Hard to the left
And clockin' a-gripsin' the death pockets of the head knock rhythm

Stupid dope fiend beat low hung blood spray all over

Scum worshiping

Pun2k weight holding heretics
Boundary reapin'

System blower, system over
Got heads jumpin' out their skin
Talkin' 'bout, "Come on
Death grip me again"
No need to wonder if
It's gonna crack
Hell no, you can bet
We're fit to burn the
House to the ground
Soon as the sound gets checked

[Bridge 1]
System blower, system over

[Verse 3]
Yeah, trick, go fetch my whip
Gotta let a mark know
Who he's fuckin' with
Ruthlessly skin a chump
Just for kicks
Can't fuck with this
Sadomaso-kiss my fist
Suck my dick, it's not cool
I'm too sick, what time is it?
System blower, system over
Deep in the klink base
Cut straight to the chase
Like a triple shot of 180 proof
Kill-o-watts riots audio violence
Breaks your windows and
Takes all the loot
System blower, system over
Silver coin on your eyes
Forever closed
Raise the dead
How long I been tired of that old
Can't nod my head
Shit is over
System blower

[Outro]
System blower

Fuck you starin' at? Didn't know I'd be so quick to flash, Terrified by the way a basilisk come out him skin so fast
Not the first, won't be the last
Barrel of my gun down the hatch
187 deep throat chokin'
Eat this fourty-four magnum dick (up)
Murder the bar raiser, inverted cross fader
Ash lung blastin' bum rush balls to the wall, bitch slayer
Rainin' blood, burnin 'paper, A. Jackson's catchin' vapors
Fuck this cage, I'll thrash you later

[Verse 2]
Step to me with that bullshit like I don't know what you're doin'
Talkin' fast, lookin' shady
You can't fade me, keep it movin'
Hopes that mo' cash will help you cope
Sorry to tell you, but it won't
"How do I get out then?" You don't
Can't keep this locked down, fuck that
Watch me now, fit to crush that
Hit it once, knock it down and I'm done can't
Stop this break out, get it come back
Underground railroad, gunclaps
To sound of sirens screamin'
Count on it, I'm leavin'

[Hook]
I say kill it like you, you say hate it
Kill it like you hate it, kill it like you hate it

Yeah I got that man, fo' show
But tell 'em why you had to get 'em though

[Verse 3]
(Get 'em, get 'em, cause I had to get 'em though)
Cause the beat bangs, cause we came to flip the oz out your sleep train
When the smoke clears, who remains?
This right here, why we claim
Out of nowhere, for keeps game
Don't go there, this the real thing
(Get 'em, get 'em, cause I had to get 'em though)
Board the plane, they're watchin' me
Bullshit stains what they want from me
Fuck that man, my philosophy:
Don't take a goddamn thing
Voice in my head, "Kill everything"
(Startin' with this asshole right next to me)
(Get 'em, get 'em, cause I had to get 'em though)
(Get 'em)

Hot shit, cold shit
Okay, muthafucka, let's do this
Came to make it band sawed off razor edge maintained looseness
Comin' through, again and again conduit
Why them hands wave to
High to it
Wild fire through your city
Wild fire through your whip me
Into lightning two

End beat limbo, baba spitting
Blood in slow mo, la la chimney

Forensics on that wild goose
Follow my footprints into loops

Cause I'm too high, too high
Feel like I'm never ever gonna come down
(Scale richter pun2k weight
Of dis sound)
Scale richter pun2k weight
Of dis sound
Down break dead space
And make it drop
To the street beneath
Your ghetto box
Slap the beat 'til the
Floor boards crack
'Neath the weight of this lic, step back
Off in the rhythm like
Beta in the bong
Got to give 'em make 'em
Sway like palms
In the wind my lip blow
Mic spray kyrlon
25-8 till the break of dawn

(War war war war)

[Verse 3]
Guerilla bass, straight from the trenches
Posers impaled on picket fences
How to rest your head in roach-infested basements and smoke pun2k weight for breakfast
Chop shop lifted, bump till the tape deck break
Ask samo how he flipped that material girl's pancakes as zydeco copper kettles
Liquor sto', sellin' singles
Mug shots out, to my people
Rollin' I double l spread eagle
Hear flow, then spit evil

Hung from dem nail, hang 'em high, savior faire

Jackal-headed dawn of the under
Check it, check one check
You can suck it 'til I get disgusted

[Bridge]
Fuck that, naw fuck that

Bitch slapped across the street and back
Head crack, wanna know where I'll be at, whatever

[Verse 2]
Get off mine I got that juice, noo style
Cut your brain stem as my combat boots grind your head
To the cadence of this dreath stompin' mu
Sick as fuck contagion wagin' war with all you knew, bitch
Mossberg ballistic flux massive
My shure beta 58a hazmatted
Pump pump slugster radioactive
Ride through a mine field laced wit black magic
Straight from the mayday, naw fuck that (one)
Broke off its axis, polar shifted granite
Knock made ta off every last bitch on this planet
Fuck that, naw, fuck that

[Verse 3]
Came ta bad dem brains 'til dem neck bones crack
Arrested cardiac, black mass murder rap
Dealer push your wig all the way back
Head wear your face like a yamakulapse

Eyes stuck on the sky always gettin' jacked
Tryin ta lookin the mirror like fuck that, naw

Drop it like-
Oh yeah, that's so trashy
How low can you go?
How dirty can you get? Nasty, fucker
Drug through the dirt
Razor cut that eight millimeter make it hurt
Chain sleaze leather face
Fucker please, you must be smokin' rocks
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Hit it, fuck it, feel it, whip it, burn it, turn it out and kick it to da curb
Shut it down
Forged in the flames, said it before and I'll say it again
Quazar game maximum vacuum rotation spin s-s-s

[Hook]
Bitch please, you must be smokin' rocks

Fucker please, you must be smokin' rocks

When shit goes down I'll be there
With my hand on my gun, and my eyes on the road
Ghost ridin' to hell, fuck if I care
Who wanna catch my droze?
Give a fuck, blood, I ain't goin' nowhere
Templar night and day, live an die by the code
Code of the street, how to stay in the zone
How I own it and freak it to the base of the bone
I am the darkness creeping through your system
The lash of da whip
Cracking every bitch
Into position
Workin' you over crashing and burning in a blackhole blasting out
Your subwoofers are melting
Hear a bitch say, "Why's he yelling?"

[Bridge]
Who wanna catch this gun clap?
Shrapnel off me lip cause blood bath

Smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't stop
Bitch, please

Hey, no ins and outs
Come out, your shit is gone, bitch

[Verse 1]
Goin' back to Tangier with some Jordans and a spear
Post-Christian shit, post-chicken-or-the-egg-addiction shit
Pass the sherm stick, Neo-reality
Be the freak you wanna see, just don't follow me
I'm on a journey to the center of three
Grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane
While everybody's like (Nooooo!)
I got this pregnant snake; stay surrounded by long hairs
A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs
Make your water break in the Apple Store
Sink or swim, who fucking cares, cut the birth cords
Press send, yeah, thick
Gaga can't handle this shit, headed for the Sammy Davis wing
Throw up a black hole at the entrance of Linens-n-Things
On the way, never call it a day
Visit Tesla's grave for the ninth time today
Still on the way, bigger wigs

You'll catch a jpeg to the head, über reach
You're an intern, I'm Wikileaks
Most loved, therefore most hated
Come and knock on the door, we've been waiting for you
Game changer, reclusive-aggressive
Ying-ing and yang-ing, noided
Info warrior, Jack the Hacker
The rolling stoner, puffin' on disaster
My existence is a momentary lapse of reason
Got the DNA of gothic lemons
Shred it thirteen times out of eleven
Your bad ideas are the ATM, shed my skin
Leave it for the homeless to sleep in
Prodigal, fuck that, nautical
Teachin' bitches how to swim (I'm in)

Now backstroke, through your k-hole
Don't run, you might slip
The table's flipped, now we got all the coconuts, bitch

[Verse 3]
Burmese babies under each arm
Screaming beautiful songs
The cray-cray ultra-contrarian
Havin' conversations with your car alarm
When you come out, your shit is gone
Soon your crew will be serving sandwiches named after me
Vietnamese style, fool, please
Front row at the mass games, untraceable by name
You speak of us in certain circles, you will be dethroned or detained

[Bridge 3]
Gone, gone
Your shit is gone, gone

My stone wall it's on, dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi, okay, okay, feel me
I'm in an eight high abandoned building
No daylight, one midnight lamp lit twenty-four seven
Murdered out windows, two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion
So I'm surrounded
Geiger count it, not goin' out, shit's 'bout to get kamikaze
Fuck a nazi

[Verse 1]
When the world comes knocking
Fuck the world, fuck this body
Know it won't be long now
Feel my nerves wet my brow
Mood in my tomb, red moon heavy
Sling jaw shot, out the window and yell
Come up and get me

[Verse 2]
I'm epiphanic amnesia
I'm in Jimmy Page's castle
I'm off the planet
Echo astral
Vinyl lasso
The Sacto asshole
I'm not down for anything
Fuck around and say anything

[Hook]
My stone wall it's on, dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi, okay, okay, feel me

Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion
So I'm surrounded
Geiger count it, not goin' out, shit's 'bout to get kamikaze
Aaaaaah!
Fuck a nazi

[Bridge]
Come up and get me!

[Verse 3]
My life as a fuck
Ain't one thing I don't hate
Tell me my times almost up
I will say, "I can't wait"
Put your gun to my head
I'll blow smoke in your face
Think you got what it takes?
Come up and get me

[Verse 4]
Can't tell, hell in my head
Thirteenth bell; am I dead
Or in asylum? Pill force-fed
Lyin' to myself, all by myself
Strapped down to my bed
Tongue cut out the mouth of reason
And chucked off the river's edge
Think fast: Is it tear gas or fear masked
By figments of my fragmented mind?
Who's my enemy, them or me?
Step to me and you'll die
Grand delusions magnified
Fuck the truth, wastes my time
It's all good, bet; what's that?
Footsteps on the stairs?
Never could rest; they're always there
Who are they? I don't care
I just know they're tryin' to ex me
Give a fuck, come up and get me

Burn through it, burn through it
I'm not takin' turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin' turns to it, turns to it

[Verse 1]
Coughin' up sirens, I'm firin'
Krokodil lips off your smile
Quit that fidget looks suspicious
Who that screw that ain't got my digits?

[Hook 2]
Fear over pride (Lil boy)
Flood you can't hide (Lil boy)
Face of a woman (Lil boy)
Tears of a child (Lil boy)

[Verse 2]
I'm rising sign of sulfur
Skeletal bell toller
Handle in each of my tentacles
I'm moonshining juice, don't try me
Live to feel life beat me, nothing hurts
I'm seething, your smoke signals proceed me
I'm inside my TV where everyone but I can see me
(Why are you here?)

Fear over pride (Lil boy)
Flood you can't hide (Lil boy)

See myself come spin through top of you
My flint lit slit that attitude
Lil brain got confused
Choo choo train of thought in my logic loop

[Hook 2]
Fear over pride (Lil boy)
Flood you can't hide (Lil boy)
Face of a woman (Lil boy)
Tears of a child (Lil boy)

[Verse 4]
Broken hands on all my fingers
Buckle down my knuckles like screamers
Stitch up my blown out trench with leather streamers
I'm chain-linked fence that splits dream and dreamer
I keep 'em hangin' from my balcony, shrivel in my sun
Warm piss showin' through his cheap slacks, this bitch is done
Open my front, ragin' like I've never slept
Make him cry like a baby formula on the breath

[Hook 2]
Needle of your eye (Lil boy)
River Nile wide (Lil boy)
Fear over pride (Lil boy)
Flood you can't hide (Lil boy)
Face of a woman (Lil boy)
Tears of a child (Lil boy)
In a foreign land (Lil boy)
Single file

You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin turns to it, turns to it
Burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin turns to it, turns to it

How the trip never stops
On and on, it's beyond insane
Why I set myself up
In a raging sea of flames?

Exhale your will and forget I ever knew you

Fuck a man with hips for hulu
Rack a snitch, chalk and cue you
Corner pocket consume you
Too many hoes in my

Asking if I know how a motherfucker feels

Slit them choke, flip them boat
Dead bitch float, swollen corpse
No remorse, navigated off course
Off course I can make you scream but if you ask for more
Bullshit, matador, grab the floor, whip it cracked to all fours

Down a spiral stair case winding to hell

Fuck it, now I can't quit, will never be the same

I'm fit to hurt you; gives a fuck about the way I move weight?
Dark matter, flu state of consciousness
Blew straight through you won't do shit
But beg me to do this
Again and again and again and again
Strangler clutch, sine wave deconstruct
My way or no way, bangin' hey makin' lust
Lucid nut shake shake it up

Came like, what

Flat busted on front street cake cuppin'
Say you wasn't lion mane

My forefinger flippin' pentagrams
Left hand catch them pix by them peak,
Facin' south
Pinhole pic of my wingspan, jail breakin' doubt
Highest vibration, ninth ring of fire crowned
War cry feel my call, hear my chamber revolve
In your brain like the halls of Amenti
Treat a bitch like a whore
Leave your pink sock at the door
Saturn level flexed
Like these fractals, I coalesce
I'm not takin' this shit anymore
One way in, come again, one way in, no way out
Cheek in tongue when in doubt, feel me now
Violators, feed 'em vapors, don't do me no favors

My life on a limb about to break
I'm a tower 'pon tectonic plate

Why you think I'm havin' everything you're rimmin' ass for ask 'em
Whose ass they're rimmin' when I'm flaggin'
Load your cannon, shutter flash heavy damage
Steady hand shit, forget me, you can't bitch
Slappin' click-clack tricks stretch please

Fuck atlas, my ego palms planets
Fuck you, yeah, yeah, it's that fuck you can't stand slip
Cut you 'cause I can dip

Sweaty palm get caught bluffin'
Fold a man into nothin' for nothin'
My oxidized gold shaft floods your jugular with Lucifer
I'll shoot it word, feel like you swallowed Jupiter
Today your city, tomorrow lifting the universe
One way in, come again, one way in, no way out
Cheek in tongue when in doubt
Feel me now

You live in hiding
You're climbing the walls, no privacy
I'm trying to survive but I'm dying; die with me
Blow out the lights, take your life
Ride the falling sky with me
Falling inside of me
It's all suicide to me

[Refrain]
It's all suicide
It's all suicide
It's all suic-
World of dogs
It's all suicide, it's all suicide, it's all suicide
It's all suicide, it's all suicide, it's all suicide

[Verse 2]
World of dogs gone mad
Above the law in your ass
Fire trash meltdown, I'm not here
I'm world of dogs, infrared
Tear me apart, left for dead
But I'm not dead yet
Sick 'em, sick 'em, yes

It's all suicide
It's all suic-

[Verse 3]
Cut it
Don't tell no one, no one can know, come closer
I'm almost over, lower sinkholer
I'm nothing, feed me to this world of dogs
Barely breathing in this world of dogs
Foam of feral reality forming on mountains of teeth
Devour the hand, spit out the leash
Crown the beast, my throne's the street
Too cold to sleep, I kill myself, I feel no pain
I'm obsolete

[Outro]
World of dogs

Corner of my eye
The coroner's here; why?
Under pressure

My back bone slip left to the death
Massive procession of cold sweat
Stalactite step slide through, you're next
Get me inside I'll do the rest
(Them things, them things, don't even ask me)
Master of self-contained combust
Sustained disgust, command him claim
Figure eight strut, can't be touched
Subversive infiltration reign supreme in none me trust
Why must them? Fuck them
Mine vomit stain them, feel not but hate them
Line up back facin', suspense rapes them
One by one hot cum shot clip spray them
Life drop and waste them in pine box laid them to
Grime dismantled, churn the fat
Light the candle, burn the wax
Before me dies, in scorch uprise
Can't deny it, no way back

Invoke ancient locc to the brain in a blaze ignition weightless world
Warped rotation, path is blurred
Memento mori, dead man's curve
Oblivion transcender becomes him shroud
I can't remember, I'm no one now
Comin' for yours, lock your doors
Identifier: destroyer
Come on, stick me, cut me, drain me, suck me, drink me, take me down
Feel me one three make your pumping chamber pound and drown

I'm barely there, I'm everywhere
Heavy thin air, Sahara mascara smeared, end of an era
Tracks on Hera's peacock thighs, china white skies, ivory of my leper eyes
Tone of sighs off nylon lips
(Where you runnin' now?)
In fishnet wet guise of gimp horizon, slit bled like my wrist, I suck it dry like from the tit
Which nipple's mine? Read the signs, still can't decide
(At your own risk) At your own risk
Don't touch me bitch! (Don't touch me, bitch)
(Where you runnin' now?)
Accustomed to these satin glitches, drippin' from my casket's innards
Charmer play me out the basket, last image I saw was splintered
My reflection, I wasn't in it, in slow motion, I give in
(Where you runnin' now?)
(Where you runnin' now?)
Hopeless premonitions
Tomorrow didn't come, some say it's hiding, but they're the ones who've hidden
Euphoria followed by visions of peasants eating pigeons

Hole in this platinum ship of fools, nomadic rule, concept, no rules
Mobile shrine of this destitute wasteland mute
Screamin' at me, winkin' at me, like I love it
Fucking with me... Fuck it!
My star gate in a vacuum, monitor's eye view
This valley is an urn, this valley I'm wadin' through

Feel like I'm chasing after me, feel like dead weight in a sea of vaseline
All that can't be seen watching me watching me watch them watch me
Try not to dwell on my cell, my empty shell shedding me

Artificial death in the west-east
Pyramids on deck (shine)

Blare my organ for juice, pipes spike blonde kinks on my boots
Approach me licking his fur, whining, "I demand a word"
Swine must be the all the way hatched, hella yolk raining down his chest
Clucking so fucking hard, glance heartbeat through his vest
So I'm like, "Go ahead, blood," but my mind's on my wrist
Five minutes pass, I'm-a have to make you my piss
Gimp just kept shaking so I had to braid him like this
Comfort over freedom, pave a path of leisure, have it all
Freedom over comfort, give you back so much leisure, feel small
Xeroxed man dressed in gauze, spider silk, and menopause
Mustache showered with applause, squished out packets like taco sauce
Gather crowd, laugh it off, Mr. Zogged by your boss

Big Dipper, Big Dipper, Big Dipper
Big Dipper, Big Dipper, Big Dipper
Big Dipper, Big Dipper, Big Dipper

[Hook]
I'm a bullshitter
I'm a shitty stripper
I'm a silhouette lifter
I'm a struck stuck off kilter
I'm a bent bewildered
I'm a fucking downer
I'm a binge thinner
I'm a Big Dipper
I'm a

[Outro]
It's my pyre, agoraphobe if I want to, afford to be
Consumed
This pyre's my costume; get too close, it'll lick you
Like it likes you, cause it loathes you even more than I do

I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States

[Verse 1]
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
Everything rigged at this place, it's not me
Don’t break my concentration with those thoughts baby
I don’t care about real life, I don’t care about real life
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
Everything rigged at this place, it's not me
Don’t break my concentration with those thoughts baby
I don’t care about real life, I don’t care about real life

[Verse 2]
Feel just like I look to you
Gawk at me all you see is you
Anyday trip, mayday trip
Can’t break my face, I’m in a state trip
Feel just like I look to you
Gawk at me all you see is you
Anyday trip, mayday trip
Can’t break my face, I’m in a state trip

[Verse 3]
Spit on you, spit on me
All we know spit must be us
Spit fits us, we spit and sniff
We sniff and clutch each other’s fate
I don’t care about real life, I don’t care about real life

[Hook]
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I don’t care about real life, I don’t care about real life
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States

[Outro]
Too many mirrors share my face
Can’t braille which mirrors my mistake
Too many mirrors wear my face
These broken mirrors take my place
I don’t care about real life
Too many mirrors share my face
Can’t braille which mirrors my mistake
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States

Inanimate sensation
Vantage perspective from objective it came from
Inanimate situation
No relation, close liaison
No conversation, no social contagion
Bother me, wanna be comrade intrusive
I remain
Inanimate aloof skip
Counterfeit
Like no can do, bitch
My vinyl vibrate higher than you, bitch
I represent, ain't meant to pursue which
One of you, oh you all wanna ride, well, I ain't got room stress
While we continue to make shit tight the loosest
Aaaah

[Hook]
Blown out
Base

[Verse 2]
You got a minute
You're in my way
What's wrong
Wrong with who
So what's going on?
Okay
Where you at right now?
I'm not with you
Inanimate persuasion
Strictly still life with all of my occasion
Inanimate surge of inspiration
Glow like thermonuclear invasion
Compared to swapping thoughts; regurgitation
I revel in lack of slightest acquaintance
No rancid level after taste inanimate negate opinion
As it unravel like enigmatic onion
Layers of interdimensional dominion

[Hook]
Blown out
Base

[Verse 3]
Yeah, bitch
Bitch, bitch
My smoke, my butane
My boots, my headphones, my medicated noose
My deadroom, my schwartzwald hat, my Mac
My macaque skull, my lysergic stash
Empty streets at night, my bike
Apartment sink filled with dry ice
Condemned tenement, brandished rail spike
Disturb in flat noir and stale white
Grey cloud curled around my bearded compound like boa
One of two thunderbolt we ain't broke on tour
Concrète antique trapdoor twenty-four
Spots to get that get right
When I gotta get right some more
Type of get right I can't afford
I covet these things more than any living
I've never been

[Hook]
Blown out

[Verse 4]
I'm so Northern California, I call scratch "bammer"
Pure overhander
Live show on a banner
Axl Rose in a blender
Slash on Satan's fender
Rick James on the cover
Running through your lover
Like mean Mr. Mustard
Stadium style
For those who came to jock
Watch that man salute you
Endless nameless Lady Godivas we snoop to
Like eighty-three mermaids in Brooklyn Zoo
Inanimate ghetto box we used to pimp through

[Hook]
Blown out

[Bridge]
Inanimate fixation
Obsessed with my demo tape collection
Inanimate riffs I'm glazin
Brag you're making music, naw, you're makin' bacon
Skinhead, skinhead inna dublin
I like my iPod more than fuckin'

[Hook]
Blown out
Base

I'm smoking cigarettes in the shower; when they get wet I just light another, fatal
Cardiac over cancer, don't gimme no suffer
Steal me over feel me linger, until I'm six under
Ain't a fucking thing sacred, when I get naked
It's death!

[Verse 1]
I'm lighting up like Vegas
All sevens king of pentacles
I'm chaining like it's money, dirty money, surgeons general
As if my flesh keeps me prisoner
As if
I've been spinning chambers since the day I was born
Like, what's it all for?
Like, why the fuck not?
Fuck if I don't get off I don't know how to be caught

[Hook 1]
I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'm turned off won't be back soon
Look up see my nuts slap the moon
I'm turned off like a myth
Can't look me up, I don't exist
I spin the chamber 'tween my lips
I pull the trigger like a gif
I can't get hit, I've never lost
I'm a rumor, I'm turned off

[Verse 2]
My footprint precedes me follow me
I'm all the way over my species
My footprint so dropped it's bottomless
Species call my redwings apocalypse
You want this bitch I drop a bitch
Snuff your bloodclot metropolis
Trail of anonymous casualties
Pah pow boom, mastery
I've been over that glass house
All my windows blacked out
Straight jacked up, the fuck up
Guts up man down
My man stand down
I'm not with it
I drop liquid
Red light district
Can't be finished
You never started
You run for martyr
While I'd push harsher
Lose it more further
Lose it more nerder
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
(Boom boom boom boom)

[Hook 2]
I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow pah pow
Take off my shirt cause it hurt, form of murder
Art of indifference trump consequences
Like first off, I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow

[Bridge]
Trust me you can't trust me try trust me you'll see why
When I see you through the ringer, my ringer catch deuce deuce
I repeat like pi my ringer catch deuce deuce divided seven times
I'll lead you to where am I

[Hook 2]
I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off

Luck's on your side, you're feeling yourself, huh, fucker?
That about enough
Well, guess what fucker
Fucker, try and game me, then

[Verse 2]
Try and tame me
It's not about you, fucker
Don't make me make this about you, fucker
Try and tame me, I dare you
Try and tame me, how dare you?
I stand through you
Obviously
I laugh when you ask if you're under my spell
Obviously
I guide your demise like funeral sails
Obviously
My touch tied to strings that steer my figures inside out their wax
You pour, I swill, you're false like tears, priceless to feel my subjects crack

[Hook]
Why a bitch gotta lie?

Try and tame me, I'll redirect
Ain't fucker tame me yet
Fit to try and tame me, be my guest
Just try and game me, bitch
Try and tame me - I'm like, "So, anyway"
Try and game me - I'm like, "No, not today"
This bitch
Try and tame me
I'll make you mine

[Hook]
Why a bitch gotta lie?
Why a bitch gotta lie?
Why a bitch gotta lie?

[Outro]
Try and tame, if you're so sure
Ain't dead or alive, ain't wore this floor
My floor tremble
Your voice, silencer
I make your choice
I make no excuses, just fucking noise
Try and tame me, maybe not up to you because
Can't tame me I'm proof of
Fuck you gonna do, scream?

I saw you doing peace signs with the F.B.I
Might've tried that in the future before so don't lie
All dead dogs go to heaven cause dumb bitches let them in
They're just racist and they wanna fuck
God chills out cause she doesn't touch
This is where I don't come in, this is where I have been maybe
Have a sad cum, baby (beh, beh, beh, beh)

[Hook]
I fuck it out and I dip-dip-dip
Drop you like asses and you trip-trip-trip
I can't stop it when I drip-drip-drip
You can't stop it when you drip-drip-drip
I piss on your face like I'm PSS-PSS-PSS
You lick up the place like you're PSS-PSS-PSS
We pick up the pace like we're PSS-PSS-PSS
I'm the fuck you're chasing like PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS

[Verse 2]
My shit's been retarded since beginning of time
I'm up in your party like sickest one line
I'm the only thing ever on my mind
You're one of those things I never rewind
I'm coming out your pocket like carving pools with my jewels
I'm throwing heebie jeebies like iTunes
The cars that go boom, these are my gold bars melted on spoons
My junk hits like martial law, you nod like, "True" (beh, beh, beh)

[Hook]
I fuck it out and I dip-dip-dip
Drop you like asses and you trip-trip-trip
I can't stop it when I drip-drip-drip
You can't stop it when you drip-drip-drip
I piss on your face like I'm PSS-PSS-PSS
You lick up the place like you're PSS-PSS-PSS
We pick up the pace like we're PSS-PSS-PSS
I'm the fuck you're chasing like PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS

[Bridge]
If I were her and she was him we would go and fuck ourselves again and again
Life is very dangerous and it wants to rearrange us like your friends, like the end
Show me into Target and I'll show you how I bought it with my mind in my mind
Touch it out in the parking lot, fuck me while the whole world watch us waste our time

[Hook]
I fuck it out and I dip-dip-dip
Drop you like asses and you trip-trip-trip
I can't stop it when I drip-drip-drip
You can't stop it when you drip-drip-drip

I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
I'm what the fuck happens
I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
I'm what the fuck happens
I can't know what I'm 'bout to do

[Chorus]
I've got the powers that B
Running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but—

[Verse 1]
I'm what the fuck happens when shit happens
When a fuck gives under no circumstances
Off your clock shit memory persist a clock shit
Lick lick a shot, shit's cracking
I'm when shit happens, cause I'm not acting
Like it like it or not, I'm on that shit; you're not
I'm this ceremony I gouge you 'til you're free
As my testimony to the powers that B
Powers that b

[Bridge]
I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
When I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
I'm what the fuck happened
And I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
Until its too late for you
To steal my name, bow down on cue

[Chorus]
I've got the powers that B
Running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but—
The powers that B
Are running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but—

[Verse 2]
I got on my shit kickers
Smoke coming out my fingers again
Can't fuck with the physical world
Cause I comply with the powers that B
I'm never over right now
My stretchers rollin', I'm in the white house
The black light house, I'm above this life now
I'm above my life now
I'm beneath me
Raised on short notice by the powers that B
Powers that B

[Verse 3]
Hook me, catch me, squeal me in
Gut me, hack me, crop your grin
Pack me, sell me, claim we're friends
See me on the street, drop your grin
Squint your beady eyes and flinch
Like a sniveling shiesty snitch
Don't fret, I know you're just a bitch
I get paid by the universe
Morbidly blasé when I'm not on display
Turn up my mic, your hair turn white
I get paid by the universe
I'm on salary
You get no fucks from me
I run the company
On the powers that B
I get paid by the universe

[Chorus]
I've got the powers that B
Running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but—
The powers that B
Are running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but—

[Outro]
No I ain't shit and I like that
You want a statement, I'm like, "Why's that?"
You're parasite's showing, that's not my bad
Your bad's pathetic, your bad's your price tag
Your bad's embedded in your lives, a white flag
A sterilized white flag, born, bred, and buried in it
Wears you like a cherry finish, keeps you valuable and shiny
You're a shiny clown to me and the powers that B

Canopy of corpse tree, branches loom above me
Vacuum of crushing, doom lies before me
My future dies behind me, my entry aborts me
I lean back and drill me, like on me I'm feeding
I'm starving, I hardly ever feel like being
Oh, just wait for a second

[Chorus]
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive
I'm beyond alive
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive
I'm beyond alive

[Bridge 1]
Fuck I have's, all I need
Fuck I can's, all I bleed
Fuck I am, ever will be
I rise, I fall, I roll again
I have no age, I don't pretend I'm here
My absence stains me sketch gets weird
I thrive on empty

[Verse 2]
Can't predict me with them petty, such a pity
My peak keeps rising, they keep sinking
Into lakes they're crying, I keep spitting
Wish I could see them dying, but my peaks too fucking misty
Tilt your lump, till back of your brains 'tween your weak slumped shoulder blades
Still can't scope peak I pave into one-way street to space
Grovel in gravel at my base, while saddle control you seek
This world of cattle at my feet, born to get put back to sleep
At my feet, born to get put back to sleep

[Chorus]
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive
I'm beyond alive
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive
I'm beyond alive

[Bridge 2]
I roll like I don't know no better
I roll like bitch you know better
You have my utmost disrespect
I'm high as fucked up get

[Verse 3]
I crash on bed of nails, in my frail suit of scabs I relax
While having seizures in my shack
I take no breather, I took the pact
I grind this stone into my path
I wait for you in this disguise
Remorselessly beyond alive
Beyond alive

[Chorus]
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive
I'm beyond alive
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive
I'm beyond alive

[Outro]
My life as a face without eyes
Look away, look away, look away, look away
No reply, I'm beyond alive
My life as a face without eyes
Look away, look away, look away, look away
No reply, I'm beyond alive
My life as a face without eyes
Look away, look away, look away, look away
No reply, I'm beyond alive
My life as a face without eyes
Look away, look away, look away, look away
No reply, I'm beyond alive

Fuck the sun, fuck its kind
Daylight sucks, waste of mine
I fuck my mind, narrow my mind
I bide my time like fuck in place
One day, I'll wave sun to ice
Watch its kind get thrown like rice
My cackle stretch out like thunder
So fucking loud, it's vulgar

[Chorus]
I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances, closed road, no road left to travel

[Verse 2]
I know what this calls for
Where's my scalpel? Operation cut
Like I'm bored, sew my inner war up like corn rows
My internal war blows, like freezing fog in Oslo
Frozen, I can't get soft, baptized in hoarfrost
Like carbon monoxide garage
Freeze your blink like sandman's flush
I hate you so much
I hate your laws
I hate your need a cause
I hate your faux touch
I hate every last one of you
I ponder digesting razors, just to be done with you
I love you so much

[Sub-verse]
I'm triple the motherfucker
Mondo-fisted, full of backwards
From banana town manor
My slang step like legless lizard
I fuck around, fashion a rocket
Shoot to Mercury, for the winter
Extended vacation till I decompose on my splinters

[Chorus]
I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances, closed road, no road left

[Bridge 1]
To centuries of damn
I've never been so yawn
Can't believe I'm still standing
Can't believe life take this long
I stagger off to find my lighter
I don't return until the day Sag A* validates
Mankind's destiny in a worm

[Verse 3]
By the way, I don't pet bleachers
Court side to nose bleeders
Like I shoot shit with gimps
No response, lose 'em once
Incoming second attempt
To be real, I just shoot 'em up (just shoot 'em up)
Them clueless strut nailed to crucifix Lilith shoved up her cunt (shoved up her cunt)

[Bridge 2]
Fuck

[Chorus]
I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances, closed road, no road left
I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances, closed road, no road left

I'm fucking tired of all the perks
I've tried nothing, everything works
For less I'm worth, I've served my bid
All fuck life wasn't what it is
All fuck life was just a bridge
I seen some free landed some tricks
Far I see high time man quit
Won't let you know when I get going
Phone ring too long

[Bridge]
Phone ring too long, I'm probably gone
Ring tone jingle my swan song
I'll show you how to leave well enough alone
I'm not this world this on cue world
I fall back, concoct new worlds
I fall out in throbbing swirls
I fall until I stop this world
I fall the fuck off this world

[Verse 1]
I live down the street from you've
Noticed me, I've never seen you
Wonder what the fuck I do
Listen up, you nosy bitch, listen close
My most recent purchase, old black rope
Gonna learn how to tie it, hang it in my chamber
Perfect reminder, occult I'm made of
Come try it out whenever you wanna
Last night, 3:30 in the morning, Death on my front porch
Can feel him itching to take me with him, hail death
Fuck you waiting for
Like a question no one mention
He turns around, hands me his weapon
He slurs, "Use at your own discretion, it's been a pleasure, Stefan"
Head on like dead, on like grey
Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way
I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way
I'm on one like bae, you're on your way, way, way, way
Head on like dead, on like grey
Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way
I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way
I'm on one like bae, you're on your way, way, way, way

[Hook]
I'm fucking tired of all the perks
I've tried nothing, everything works
For less I'm worth, I've served my bid
All fuck life wasn't what it is
All fuck life was just a bridge
I seen some free landed some tricks
Far I see high time man quit
Won't let you know when I get going
Phone ring too long

[Verse 2]
Don't you worry, impossible for anything to be a big deal
I'm in no weary, my vital post dated
But clearly been ages since life had appeal
Far more than fascination
My second nature chant kill cause I can
This body by my own hands
My friends and family won't understand
So I stay in the end, don't make none to me
If it wasn't for them, I'd make that decision
On GP
Had to do it all again, I'd make that decision
On GP

[Outro]
All the nights I don't die for you
Wouldn't believe how many nights I ain't died for you
On GP
Not that I care, I'd be a liar
If I sat here claiming I'd exit in a minute
But I can't say I wouldn't I have my limits
All the nights I don't die for you
Wouldn't believe how many nights I ain't died for you
On GP
Not that I care, I'd be a liar
If I sat here claiming I'd exit in a minute
But I can't say I wouldn't I have my limit
All the nights I don't die
(I'm fucking tired)

I keep, I keep
Good ideas
I keep, I keep giving bad
Giving bad people...

[Chorus: Clementine Creevy]
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

[Verse 1: Ride]
Those who can’t adjust
Ten fold dismantled pus
Operandi minus modus
My phlegm you to dust
Dragon chaser
I’ll quit later
Asteroid to midnight powder
This like genocide just louder
Fuck who we going after
Fuck them, I’m a have to fuck them over
And the closer, shows over
Bet bitch much, you wanna bet, bitch?
Keep that o and x shit
Feed a narc my driveway
Don’t trip ‘cause I may

[Chorus: Clementine Creevy]
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

[Verse 2: Ride]
I cough up locks, catatonic jingle
Mausoleum treatment, strands of chemo
Unwell out my slit gashes tempo
I’m crawling with swarming crescendo
Execution, my nerves I’m slurring
You deserve this, your worthless disturbs me

[Bridge: Clementine Creevy]
I want you to next time
It doesn’t sound so bad when I say it in my mind
I want you to next time
It doesn’t sound so bad when I say it in my mind

[Verse 3: Ride]
Mutter, stagger, I’m in you
I got you covered, scatter, you’re meant to
Pull a lick real quick
Made off I fling
Shallow plots for senile kings
Cruelty keeps me even
I moan like flukes
Euphoria follows puke
I won’t pull my chute

[Chorus: Clementine Creevy]
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

[Verse 4: Ride]
Lead heavy lead us, remedy us
Hem me, I suffer to catch reflux
I ingest reflux
Bile threshold, cortex deluxe
Torture me lust
Holding horses with bacteria, uhh
I’m downing this vial of old Siberia
Overtoning mysteria

[Bridge: Clementine Creevy]
I want you to next time
It doesn’t sound so bad when I say it in my mind
I want you to next time
It doesn’t sound so bad when I say it in my mind

[Chorus: Clementine Creevy]
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

[Outro: Clementine Creevy]

Self-inflicted
What'd you tell them?
I just told 'em hell's existence
But you know me, don't nobody
Know my business
My presence flog your confidence
Who want a brand new complex?
Now on, I'll call you, go fetch
Self-inflicted
What'd you tell them?
I just told 'em hell's existence
But you know me, don't nobody
Know my business
Get used to fetch, I'll shoot, you catch
I snap, you come, I don't call you back
Act natural, my style attack

Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Dive bomber, dive bomber
Clip a hundred doves like a bald head rasta
Clot of the dot, got a head a piranha
Give it up, give it up, give it up
My...

[Verse 2]
My cobra head draped in mota
Hooded regime like ebola
My cobra head draped in mota
My cobra head draped in mota
My cobra head draped in mota
Hooded regime like ebola
Blink and you're over
Wouldn't shut the fuck up, answered for their behavior
Cleft palate creator
Morgue head forsaker
Phallus cloud, call me vapor
My cobra head draped in ebola
My cobra head draped in mota
My cobra head draped in mota
Hooded regime like ebola
Blink and you're over
Wouldn't shut the fuck up, answered for their behavior

Self-inflicted
What'd you tell them?
I just told 'em hell's existence
But you know me, don't nobody
Know my business
My presence flog your confidence
Who want a brand new complex?
Now on, I'll call you, go fetch
Self-inflicted
What'd you tell them?
I just told 'em hell's existence
But you know me, don't nobody
Know my business
Best get used to fetch, I'll shoot you, catch
I'll snap, you come, I don't call you back
Act natural, my style attack

Headless
I skid like Rita lifted ocean
I drift like my planet don’t spin
I skid all over marks like I’m haunted
Rev it up, twirl my la la like profits
It’s never much, I’m war torn in the cockpit
Don’t interrupt, my turbulence slaps
My path massive demands panoramic
Massive
Shitty, you’re ten thousand leagues subzero, sweat dripping
My hancock do-rag riptides like Tent City
Standoff through low lands eerie silencing

[Hook]
Greed tastes like sin
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Hyperlink
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

[Verse 2]
Peel out, press me to magnetic slab
Severe swerving I tow lag
Off uncertainty 'til your zipper locks
My salvia silhouette commence shots
Sixty shots a second on a hexed clock
I strike ‘tween each time your solar plex drops

[Hook]
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

[Verse 3]
I’m skidding out
I can’t help yourself, I skid in doubt
I’ve dealt with yourself, I tricked hell out
I’m all helter skelter, I’m on that Faust
None of me left but reflex skidding out
Pulse in my chest feel like it’s fixing to bounce
Bounce, bitch, I can’t be the road
I’m crashing into planes, I crash and stroll
Maxed out my oath
Don’t blame me, I’ve no soul

[Hook]
Greed tastes like sin
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Hyperlink
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Greed tastes like sin
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Hyperlink
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

[Verse 4]
My skids 'til the brink, I jizz snowmen
Tall knives in my grill feel potent
My jigsaw manipulates you open
My skids writ rubbernecks agent orange
I skid like I’m no use
My headband expand like I choose juice
I binge, all black enhance my tragic
Ends to a means I can’t establish
Noise of nomads on sapphire spice
Cumulus in both hands, can’t kill myself twice
Pawns tremble like dildos wielded by duppies
Traumatized on for size, roadkill hides like yuppies
I’m too passcode, these gates won’t stay closed
Control gets old, I smash out my skin
My vessel thrown like slack at the wind
I’m finally astral now, grab my stems

[Hook]
Greed tastes like sin
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Hyperlink
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Greed tastes like sin
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Hyperlink
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

[Verse 1]
Influence executed
Mass execution, rapid improvements
Toothless accent, drawl of a shaman
Putrid fanatic ride out like famine
Luminescent rattles, thunder in vials
Choose your battles or end in piles
Braided fumigation, destitution ramped
Desiccated satyr make a massacre dance

[Hook]
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

[Verse 2]
Psychotropic steel trap, rock a beat up Bears hat
Naw man, I don’t feel this and I shit on your guilt trip
Then extinguish your illness like seven grams of thorazine
Tyrannic authority cleansed by your aggressor
Inhuman elitist decline your surrender
Sign of the freak thriving on a bender
Forbidden discipline, all lines disconnected
Vacated premises occupied by my death wish

[Hook]
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

[Verse 3]
Luster of entrails stacked and slung
Under cement veils my traffic hums
Compulsion on risers, your stranglers knuckles
Your temples buckle
Decompression silo inside this muzzle
Overdriven rituals on my torso, my infernal boro
If I went soft Glock to my navel
Flaws get knocked off, flaws get knocked off

[Hook]
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Gotta flake, I fuck ‘em off ‘cause I ain’t them

My approach like I’m ghost-like
I’m out of focus ‘cause
I’m coated with the most stripes
Late movement on my trajectory
Anomalous like entropy
Make all things perforated
They apply iodine to trace this, I’m like, "Eh"

[Bridge]
Posse up steadily feel your void split, I’m like...
Posse up steadily feel your void split, I’m like..."Eh"

Who does you just like I told you?
Tell me, what’s it like, I'm like

[Verse 4]
Don’t be a, don’t be a
‘Bout mummified worm in the sun
When shit’s up to me ‘cause
I figure I’ll watch you urn, I’m not concerned
I’m on leisure like, eh
I’m just on leisure
Why fuss don’t be a medical procedure
Just stamp my fucking visa
I’m way too loose like
Catch me hanging from my noose like, eh
How I vandalize full moon like
"You’re so serious, ease off
I don’t feed animals, you seem lost"
I’m offended like, but in the end I’m like, eh

Oh, bitch try to creep like ivy

Act accordingly, I got a quota
High noon smoke rings, no high rollers
Brought your forecast and a shovel
Bubbles buried in this jungle
Bubbles buried in this jungle
Bubbles buried in this jungle
Polar jungle frozen punters
All my sculptures look so flustered
Dress code swallow dick, go get your boss
Security turn green ‘cause I never floss
Fuck everything or I up the cost
Lack pedigree, my index push pause
Notch can’t talk, I’m smearing mute
Don’t have shit locked, I hear the proof
Petty formula never amuses me
Fuck if I ever let a bitch get used to me

Fall out mercury confetti
Ebony skies, I died already
Liquor store counting pennies
I’m in motion, do you savvy?
I exhume ‘cause it relax me
Watch you think ‘bout that? Don’t fight it
Smell me though, fucker quiet
Cyclone in a gortex shell
Audio input for my spell
Show up for what? This cig’s too plush
Long as my smokescreen’s holding up
I hold this down like high contrast
Stills taken from shade on flash
I’m so shade tree it makes me laugh
Every time you reply that’s fine

Alright, alright, invasive clinical

Caught a tiny cougar even she don’t wet

Where's your heat at? It won't lit
I'm not surprised, check your thermostat, no digits
I drop a dime, you can have that, collect your tip
Go buy a rhyme and bring my cash back, you broke ass bitch

[Hook]
I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison

[Verse 2]
Never betray me, oh and while you're at it
Double my inhibitor, I can't hack it
Be my buffer, my habit hunger havoc
I digress, I can't live in this contagion
I spread into incisions on occasion
Heavily stricken witness visions
Omens wall to wall followed by a loss of any and all symptoms
It won't lit

[Bridge]
Notice me, senpai

[Verse 3]
You're like, "Hold on. Fuck, it won't lit."
Stay put, you're the wrong one, bitch don't fit
Too shook, you're flows off blood, this won't hit
Got no hook, true or false, though you can't spit
Bitter face, Frida Kahlo the Costco remix, you're a case
All you got though free shit, what a waste
How can you not know? So which is it: love or hate?
You'd rather not know why shit won't lit, fucks hesitate

Didn't mean to, I, I
Just assumed it'd be you, I, I
Never knew no idea, I, I
Was confused, excuses
It won't lit's a Rubik's cubicle
For the new cog to chew off
To sulk with and flask on
How the sick with it put my mask on

[Outro]
Zach hit them off like, "It won't lit," they shit bricks
Bbpoltergiest don't touch this, don't insist
Favorite the copyright then go home, bitch, no homeless
I'm in your house like, "Oh shit, I own this"
I'll kick your ass out, don't bitch, bitch, it's winter, bitch
Take my trash out real quick or live in it
Where's my cash out promo slip? I'm skipping shit
When I'm tacked out, my it won't lit's it won't lit

I’ll jail break ADX with a blank tarot card
Same card pull your hoe card like Zoltar
Two crystal balls dangle from my boneyard

Swiftly service me, bitch it’s called outlaw

This private ocean I carve
I’ll carve this bitch into high art
No say bitch made state of mind art
My murder spree murk out this conk
Albert Fish gaunt sunk out this conk
Strictly ugly fuck for your cunt
Cunts over easy and more blunts
Thermal strong arm gravity sink bong
Head games with an only child

America, America, now I’m coming Africa
My death is money
Whose bad? His bad
Who’s looking shitty? Not me
You think he’s listening? Probably
Mouthpiece on Sally’s like San Joaquin valley
Fuck your middle man, throw that towel in, you irk me
Yeah, yeah, go tell a friend
You’re irrelevant, ain’t shit but a skank
Skank way too far from her holding tank
Come on, girl, get your front on, girl
You rank A-list or so I hear
But no basic here, no safe bets here
Wouldn’t touch a fake bitch with latex here

She’s so, she’s so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro

[Bridge]
Party full of thirsty, lurkers hella worried
All in six high glass heels
Cinderella water hole climbing for a pot of goldie
Flip you for a twenty bill
Aim for El Dorado estimated arrival
Time it take a fuck to make a deal
Ain’t gonna make it though, try your luck in porn
You’re so thirsty, all you’ll ever earn is frills

[Verse 2]
Check two skeeze
Pop that pussy pitch into a tent
How those poles make you so bent
Push that cart peddles you ring the bell
Ring the bell though, hands full of dick
Use your elbows, door to door you sand every last floor
Deep as you can choke a quicksand storm
Lipstick lap dance won’t record

[Chorus]
She’s so, she’s so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro
She’s so, she’s so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro

Gag ‘til I’m all drenched
Gagballs drooling pools ‘cause

[Outro]
I fucked you in half
I fucked you in half
I fucked you in half
I fucked you in half

My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
Your whole life, your whole fuckin' life
Your whole life, your whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
Your whole life, your whole fuckin' life
Your whole life, your whole fuckin' life

[Verse 1]
Slippery when panickin', this seems like surfin' gasoline
At the mercy of my discrepancy
I've got countless current identities
Which one should I pretend to be?
Which will be the end of me?
Fuck my present coordinates
I will 'em dead like, like, like, like, like, like, like
It's not what you think
Fuck you want from us?
We're the same as you
But we know we're fucked
But we came as you, like you know it's us
And your mind, not you

[Chorus]
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life

[Verse 2]
Cut one, spill revelations, it's fucked
Center seal of my imagination, fucked
Forehead of mine submergin', I'm sinkin'
Noah's Ark, blood's virgin, stop thinkin'
See now? There ya go
It's alright, your write-offs belong to vultures
My whole life like vultures
Brain coverage is more like
My vision ain't no good on my sore side
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
Cut one, spill revelations, it's fucked
Center seal of my imagination, fucked
Forehead of mine submergin', I'm sinkin'
Noah's Ark, blood's virgin, stop thinkin'
See now? There ya go
It's alright, your write-offs belong to vultures
My whole life like vultures
Brain coverage is more like
My vision ain't no good on my sore side

[Outro]
This ghost town's my compound, I'm a saboteur
Your town's my smoke cloud, I stay at war
By night shift I don't exist, chump, saddle up
A dust to dust motionless struck belly up
Your skies are lip balm on my balls
Elemental cyclotron on white walls
I met you and your carne asada to cry
Fuck everything, now go ahead and pay us for my shrine, wait
This ghost town's my compound, I'm a saboteur
Your town's my smoke cloud, I stay at war
By night shift I don't exist, chump, saddle up
A dust to dust motionless struck belly up
Birch wood emoji wrought with human branches
Your innocence save your hopes, I just throw the dice
And I've been like this for my whole fucking life
My whole fucking life's your whole fucking life

Section 2

[Intro]
Panic, panic, panic, panic
Panic, panic, panic, panic
You know this bitch, this is the bitch you know
I would not fuck a basic bitch, bring a bitch and I want more
Uptight bitch, your blood’s like bitch, right? Zip tight flow
Handle a bitch, handle a bitch, handle a bitch like so
I'm not no bitch like that
That bitch go, they start off and strip like plat'
Fuckin' with C-notes, like please don't, that bitch might act
Handle a bitch, I'll handle a bitch, I'll handle a bitch like that
Woah, I'm dead, bitch
Your blood's like bitch, right?

[Verse]
Last bitch feel branded or somethin'
That bitch more ate up than my lunch
That bitch make me take my time
Makin' for change, they gonna come
Bitch always been assed out
Kiss your black ass on the mouth
Shit, had bitch, that bitch is broke
Said, broke bitch, I'm on that dope

[Outro]
Bitches more sick
I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
Bitches more sick
I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
Bitches, I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
Bitches more sick
I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
He's a bitch, she's a bitch, sorry bitch

Section 3

[Verse]
Exist like a drunk man at the wheel
But first sittin' in the front, not at the wheel
No clue I could fuck you 'cause I will
Fuck praise, all it does is pay my bills
I faced the crowd in Vegas there
Ever fake but isn't where
Shit ain't raw, they can't compare
Check AWOL, bitch, I'm always there
Intangible intrusion to the bone, through the bone
Feels human bones, human skill
Blessed on windmill and opium feel
Bumpin' shit, I leave open seal
Ghoulishly austere, paralysis is my souvenir
Exit wounds and rabbit ears
Rabbit holes that last for years
Now can you see I have no fears?
Not havin' cares, post-stratosphere
(Witness post-stratosphere)
Misspoke language of savoir faire
Don't need to come with the stolen hair
Stranger slip by, catch my interest
Look for a minute at a safe distance
Lose my place, look back, see no one
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Milk that daylight, jump this vanish
I like this type, that's refined manner
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
This is why I'm swimming in a faucet of acid
I bum a dialogue instead of renting it
Call in the place and get an estimate
It's diligent on paper, I'll invest in it
Be weird if I could make it as a mesmerist
Have a tall list of clients to tamper with
Be a practicing confessional
Cultivator of masochists
Crave sanity? I'll make you vegetables
Your family'll think like pacifists
Cool long as I don't move my tongue
Cool long as I don't bite my tongue

[Chorus]
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit

Section 4

[Intro]
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
You want to know who I am?

[Verse 1]
No one's girl, stoic girl
Only fucks fine foreign girls
Makes your muse, play it ruse
Awakens your fantasy, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory

[Chorus]
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

[Bridge]
Attention
I am the dragon from the desert

[Verse 2]
Hate makes me reckless, restraint cease the functions
You get the best of me, but I'm missin' one in my stomach
Killer for the occasion, whip you back to size
Break you like a Franklin, spend you like a five
They like, "How come? How come, though?"
They come at meals, fuck no
Right on, I'm that killer, you're a fucking sidearm
Think twice, face down
Don't bleed like this Cape Town
Don't sleep like no playground

[Refrain]
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl

[Chorus]
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

[Verse 3]
Farewell, fuck you hopeless
On three, spread out, then move in
Strategy, cauterize all loose strands
Finder's life can't be too thin
My spotlight proof to no end
Pursue this life with no friends
Bet your own at your own risk
'Cause farewell, fuck you hopeless
And act like no one notice
On three, spread out, then move in
Strategy, cauterize all loose strands
Finder's life can't be too thin
My spotlight proof to no end
Pursue this life with no friends
Bet your own at your own risk
'Cause farewell, fuck you hopeless

[Bridge]
Me and my doppelgänger have a system
My shoulder pain loads ammunition
These counterfeits are mostly sober
I pen the script, he pilots the saucer
It's funny, the bored pose of my dead man
We both scramble until I'm the last man
Stay in first so much I have four left hands
He arose disgusted, I awoke in Bethlehem

[Chorus]
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

Section 5

[Intro]
Don't ask me where I came from
Ignore me anyway but
Stick it if you think it
Happens when you can't stop

[Verse 1]
Came to in a sports cage
Five minutes, coulda swore it was a decade
Had the time of my life, no head case
Zoom with the camp where we jump for fuck's sake
Threw it off over end of the hard way
Lie back, then I shut down my heart rate
Enter threshold of blind man's hallway
Hell'll turn a tightrope to my causeway
Two burned rascals call me hombre
And now you're fuckin' with mojo
Side shift like bold fungus moonglow
I flatline straight through to the loophole

[Chorus]
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Personalized like genetics and provide all your needs
Don't be frightened by skeptics, listen essentially
You're sleeping on a goldmine

[Verse 2]
Tone of our voices means our location's a runaway
I'm before all your destinations, I'll be on display
I’m fuckin' on your schedule, explanation’s in delay
Pathway enchanted encounter, feed that hoe a chainsaw
Burned up at myself, back to the floor
Moment I do, my bustle was such a bore
Pull that way, run your vehicles 'cause you know it's cool
Put my fist on a pedestal 'til I stroke the core

[Chorus]
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Personalized like genetics and provide all your needs
Don't be frightened by skeptics, listen essentially
You're sleeping on a goldmine

[Verse 3]
No matter what, stay where you are, if you go
Don't matter who you shot, there's no scars where you are
Never felt this, but I been so lost, nothing's broke
Make your life a demand, things don't blow to be all gone

[Outro]
A hybrid night container
Carbonated thrift store
Your peter is the peak
Of hubris marked in vain
Hi

Section 6

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 1]
Fall out on impact
Never been left, what's worse
You must have that contention
That greenscape, that witch fur
What if I was strapped like toothpaste?
Like filler ass, dig grave
I feel staffed like Rick James

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 2]
Chinchilla, rich blood
Mindset, core forms
Timeless, but I admire
Improvised explosives
Glowed off, my darlins
Good labor, my harlot
Blood form
With the ice flow garnet

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 3]
Molten like karma, it's abstractions of bliss to me
Intolerance removes lava, high pressure like quick release
Counterstrike red Bambaataa on those tears
Get by, stampede off billions
Stagnant eyes, spring rupture, drop off here
Said my deadbeat

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like
Sick like, sick like
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 4]
Doubtful, you stand in pride
Turnin' me down so quiet
Silence guided by vision
Assailant inside the figure
Can't hide from suspicion
War-waging prescription
Street life breaks you like religion

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 5]
Hooded figure exploit your demons
Cast profit, go to buy, try, can't knock it
Bet a bitch forward this market
Better get numbered, you're profit
The offer day
The offer day, you're numbered
Try to flee, but you can't leave
You get paid to suffer

Section 7

[Chorus]
At the time, didn't recognize myself 'til I was petrified
But half the time I'm not myself
So most of the time I don't question why
We did testify, but best I can do is buy some time
Spend my time folding time
Even met myself one time
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body

[Verse]
Nothing matters anymore
You can’t see the kraken
Climbing out the bullshit that exists from the mouth
You can’t get out of debt
Just learn to keep on stabbing
In the heart with a fucking knife
You drop it before you can catch it
Do you see what's taxing?
All life's a moment before the grave
You're only optimally the passenger, a slave
From the middle finger
Open up the sewers before you, drop this ring, reave
The culture hiding behind this life, kill the pain

[Chorus]
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
At the time, didn't recognize myself 'til I was petrified
Black body, body
But half the time I'm not myself
So most of the time I don't question why
Black body, body
We did testify, but best I can do is buy some time
Black body, body
Spend my time folding time
Even met myself one time

[Outro]
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body (with no hope)
Black body, body (with no hope)
Black body, body (with no hope)
Black body, body (with no hope)
Black body, body (with no hope)
Nothing matters anymore
You can’t see the kraken
Climbing out the bullshit that exists from the mouth
You can’t get out of debt
Just learn to keep on stabbing
In the heart with a fucking knife
You drop it before you can catch it
Do you see what's taxing?
All life's a moment before the grave
You're only optimally the passenger, a slave
From the middle finger
Open up the sewers before you, drop this ring, reave
The culture hiding behind this life, kill the pain

Section 8

[Chorus]
All I see are sycophants
Hunting for that little bit
Never will get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Learned about how sick it is
Every word is cinema
Find me off a precipice
Flying like the state of drugs

[Refrain]
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it

[Bridge]
Dance, you motherfucker
Get on 'em, motherfucker
Get 'em like a man
Petite like Southern, hit up like clan
Ya'll nations are stuck in gutters fastened by checks
Desert creek kumbaya, feed that snake like mud
I'm too sick now to eat, I inspect my money just 'cause

[Verse 1]
Question must be scroungin'
Nobody came to flex, it's poundin'
But I bet that's next, the mountain flecks
Off this map's rips, it's grounded
By the thousands, they walked in the valley
Act like you care while I get you out of it
Like I said, get the fuck off my couch
Ain't worth shit if it ain't about me

[Chorus]
All I see are sycophants
Hunting for a little bit
Never get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Fucks you admitted for?
All I see are sycophants
Hunting for a little bit
Never get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Learned about how sick it is
Every word is cinema
Find me off a precipice
Flying like the state of drugs

[Verse 2]
I'd rather not get involved
I'm not that much, never been that much
But I saw too much to pay shit off
Too stuck, no way, weigh off that much
What can I say? Fuck what you say
You can ask around if you think I'm frontin'
Never been that much, but I got here first
Get the fuck out, bitch, while I do my work

[Refrain]
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it

Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, together’s unwise, sever all ties
Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, vomit green eyes

[Verse 1]
Half-lidded coolers, half lies as cures
Warm blanket statement, Denver air terminal patient
Rubberized, skin rubberized
For your entertainment, got two cents save it
Dozing at the helm, road paved with vagrants
Closed casket make up, lavish euthanasia
Necro Winnebago, worship on shroom in safe zones
Hilo loose brown recluse, murdered out rainbows

[Chorus]
Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, together’s unwise, sever all ties
Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, vomit green eyes

[Verse 2]
Cyanide protocol, capsule wipe too involved
Can’t hear answer I, try for wait signal my
Wait for my signal try, too late to whisper why
Besides don’t waste this fry, had to take it all at once
As yet unknown, as yet as fuck, back in the town
Now what, know what, no rush
So what, what now, fuck now

[Bridge]
Blackish green spirits of Kraków (Reptilism)
Only fog I’ve felt with features
Exception complexion of silver drinkers
Oppressive dense fog with modest demeanor

[Chorus]
Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, together’s unwise, sever all ties
Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, vomit green eyes

[Outro]
Demeanor, d-d-dark skills, d-d-dark skills
(Raise the dead, raise the dead, shit is mine
Serpent tongue, serpent tongue, serpent tongue
Serpent tongue, serpent tongue, serpent tongue)
1, 2, 3, 4

Drop the curtains soaked in shadow, more shade
Black, black paint
Drip freak freak seek seek so cold today
Black, black paint
Making sounds that don’t deserve us like blou
Black, black paint
Those are my Satanic urges right now
Right, right now

Sick people felt light up your eyes somehow
Black, black paint
Those are my Satanic urges right now
Right, right now

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

H-hold, h-hold, h-hold
This statue, this statue
Black, black paint

You think I could hold
This statue off the balcony
I think I’ll stay a while

Spin the bottle

Boom, boom, boom, b-boom, boom boom
Boom, boom, boom, b-boom, boom boom
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I’m at Glow Bowl, in a wet fuck hole
Where the 1994 hobos throw
69’s and the bitches shout
I’ll fuck you when I wanna hang out
Tell the princess eat shit and die (ownage)
Not in public, hoe, I’m still high
These pigs are crazy, dog
This narc at the dyke bar in a slow car

Got her hard like Spartacus
Put a bitch under my wing-a-ling-a-lang-lang-lang
Look bitch, fly like thus
Dope man’s dry, oh yeah right
Don’t trip mark, yo this my part
I got green David Letterman’s, dick like zen
Remember when you fainted at the bargain bins
Party time (ownage)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Good news to hell
My Toyota with some bells (ownage)
Pussy so wise
She’s trying to bump two queen drugs right between the eyes
Ownage, ownage, ownage, ownage

In a wet fuck hole
With my feet kicked up so my hair can grow
My steeze is crazy, dog
And I’m in bitch house
Talking 'bout how I’m not tryna hang out
Her steeze is crazy, dog

February 20th, Los Angeles, California
I’m in the studio with Death Grips
They’re working on their new album at Sunset Sound Studios
6650 Sunset Boulevard
They have a dilemma, but they’ll win their dilemma

[Refrain]
Dilemma

[Verse 1]
Butterfly ballistic, seax survival
Butcher kukri to trench homicidal
Can’t say I buy them, just show up lately
Lately seem to stalk me like I’m yeti
Like scream of a haunted jetty
Let me be a haunted jetty
Cross I cry banshee like manic falcon
Shrill like losing time on Shasta Mountain

[Chorus 1]
Thingany thingany, so jinx now
She’s wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style

[Verse 2]
Shine like sad hung from starry eyed gallows
Like day old glow of carbon eye shadow
Trembling young wounded mammal
Double edge gut judge choke on his gavel (Choke)
Jack slide leave atlantic puddles
Spade slip lives into stranded shuttles
I taxiderm shams with morbid shinto
This three quarter shank, one quarter disco (Choke)
Low res mega evil patina
Pattern maker of myth and trip weaver
Infamous nature in rags like reaper
Like midnight mounted by wayside seekers

[Chorus 2]
Lovely, lovely, they’re so blonde
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
Dusty, dusty, so far gone
I’m fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fucking wrong

[Bridge]
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
These knives bleed knives
They cut me, I’ll cut you
Below is above you
Above is below me
I’m dying to try on these knives
You don’t know me

[Refrain]
Dilemma
Dilemma

[Chorus 1]
Thingany thingany, so jinx now
She’s wahwah wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style
